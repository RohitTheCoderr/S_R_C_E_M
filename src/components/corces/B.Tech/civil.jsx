                    Civil Engineering is a distinguished engineering discipline focused on the design, construction,
                    and maintenance of infrastructure and built environments. This includes essential works such as
                    roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings.
                    <br />
                    The Field of Civil Engineering today requires a great deal of knowledge which includes the
                    technicalities involved in the field as well general knowledge about the structural development
                    changes in the environment and its effects on nature and also the current environment scenario
                    for the future development of the society in which we live. The Department of Civil Engineering
                    ensures that the students have the opportunity to work with latest equipment both in the
                    Laboratories and while on project with various construction companies. The Department of Civil
                    Engineering deals with the design , construction and maintenance of the physical and naturally
                    built environment , including works such as bridges, roads , canals, dams and buildings.
