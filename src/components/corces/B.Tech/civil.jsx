            Civil Engineering
            Civil Engineering is a distinguished engineering discipline focused on the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure and built environments. This includes essential works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings.

            The Field of Civil Engineering today requires a great deal of knowledge which includes the technicalities involved in the field as well general knowledge about the structural development changes in the environment and its effects on nature and also the current environment scenario for the future development of the society in which we live. The Department of Civil Engineering ensures that the students have the opportunity to work with latest equipment both in the Laboratories and while on project with various construction companies. The Department of Civil Engineering deals with the design , construction and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment , including works such as bridges, roads , canals, dams and buildings. Specializations for Higher Studies: Geotechnical ,

            Environmental Studies, Structural & Material Engineering, Construction Management, Hydropower System, Railways Engineering, Transportation Structures etc . Career Scope: Municipal Corporations, Jal Board, Delhi Development Authority, National Highway Authority of India, Public Works Department, Border Road Organizations, Irrigation & Flood Control Development, Building Constructions Department of Organizations, Metro Rail Project, Sewage treatment Plants etc .

            The field is traditionally divided into several specialized subdisciplines, including:

            • Environmental Engineering

            • Geotechnical Engineering

            • Geophysics
