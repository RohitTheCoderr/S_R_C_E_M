              Welcome to Shri Ram College of Engineering & Management. A hearty
              welcome to one and all.
              <br />
              The first decade of the 21st century is a time of unprecedented
              change for India. While Indian Industry confronts the challenges
              and opportunities of globalization and liberalization, the nation
              is faced with the imperative of rapid and sustained economic
              growth. These features of the economic and social context resonate
              strongly with the mission of the Shri Ram College of Engineering &
              Management, which is to create a cadre of professionals who are
              able to manage business activities in a dynamically changing
              environment where technology and adaptability are the key
              determinants of success. Adaptability because it is not hard to
              learn more. What’s hard is to unlearn when you discover yourself
              wrong.

          We believe, the illiterate of the 21st century will not be the one who
          cannot read and write, but the one who cannot learn and relearn.
          <br />
          <br />
          With this vision in mind, more than creating an environment where
          pupils can learn, we want to nurture an environment where pupils can
          learn to imagine because learning is what has been done. Imagination
          is what can be done. Learning leads to understanding. Imagination
          leads to innovation. Imagination is the key to the future, as it has
          been since the times of Archimedes and Newton to present day
          Technology Giants like Google and Apple. So we don’t want the students
          to graduate as mere engineers, we want to Inspire them to graduate as
          dreamers because dreamers are the actual human resource or as we like
          to call it human resource 2.0.
          <br />
          SRCEM strives to create those human resources, which through their
          business acumen and human sensitivity shall add value to the ongoing
          attempts at pushing technology and creating business value.
          <br />
          As envisaged by Tagore, providing an enabling culture to the
          participants to learn and grow fearlessly and aim for perfection, the
          institute wishes to inculcate values of personal excellence and
          concern for others thus imbibing egalitarian values which would then
          help the large society to build and manage ecologically responsible
          organizations
          <br />
          It is my sincere hope that students of SRCEM shall bring pride to the
          Institute and the Country.
