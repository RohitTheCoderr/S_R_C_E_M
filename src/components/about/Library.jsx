          Information and facts written in print media has been the most
          comfortable and reliable way of gathering knowledge since the

          topic wherein every author exhibits his understanding in his own way.
          The senior faculty of SRCEM has gone through a wide range of texts
          available for every topic related to Engineering and Management. The
          team has had a keen look at the writing style, content strength and
          relativity with the requirements and has filtered out standard books
          and journals that would benefit the students in their academics.
