          comfortable and reliable way of gathering knowledge since the

          topic wherein every author exhibits his understanding in his own way.
          The senior faculty of SRCEM has gone through a wide range of texts
          available for every topic related to Engineering and Management. The
          team has had a keen look at the writing style, content strength and
          relativity with the requirements and has filtered out standard books
          and journals that would benefit the students in their academics.
